                one of
                the four CHARDHAMS (four important pilgrimages) in the state. There are four pilgrim-destinations namely
                Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath, collectively known as Char Dham.
                <span id="dots1">...</span>
                <span id="more1"> These pilgrimage centres draw large number of pilgrims each year, thus becoming the
                    most
                    important hubs of religious travel in the whole of Northern India.

                    Badrinath is located at an elevation of around 3,100 m. Located in the Garhwal Himalayas, on the
                    banks of
                    the Alaknanda river, this sacred town lies between Nar and Narayana mountain ranges. The temple is
                    believed
                    to have been established by sage Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century. With Lord Vishnu as its
                    presiding
                    deity, the temple remains open for six months in a year. In winter it becomes inaccessible due to
                    heavy
                    snowfall.

            <p>Gangotri Temple is one of the CHARDHAM of uttarkhand, India. It is located at a height of 3048 meter and
                at a distance of 98 km from Uttarkashi. It is the highest and most important temple of the Goddess
                Ganga. “Gangotri” is Sanskrit word which means Ganga+Uttari i.e. Ganga flows in a northwesterly
                direction.
                <span id="dots2">...</span>
                <span id="more2"> This 18th century temple made of white granite structure at the height of 20 ft
                    attracts tremendous devotees to catch the holy glimpses of the divine stature of power- the holy
                    goddess Ganges. Gangotri Temple is 228 km from yamunotri temple, another pilgrim place of chota char
                    dham yatra. Uttarakashi is the gateway to Gangotri and there is no other way to reach Gangotri by
                    road. Here road ends and trekking rout to Gaumukh starts.

                    Gaumukh glacier is the source of Bhagirathi River which is also known as Ganga River before the
                    confluence with Alaknanda at Devprayag. The Glacier is situated 18kms from Gangotri. ‘Gau’ means Cow
                    and ‘Mukh’ means face hence the combined meaning of Gaumukh is cow’s face. If you carefully observe
                    the cave from where the water gushes out it will resemble as a cow’s face. Gaumukh is the second
                    largest glacier of India, only after the Siachen glacier.

                    And, a natural submerged rock in the form of partial shivaling along the Gangotri Temple brings
                    great significance to all where it is believed to be the same spot where Lord Shiva entangled the
                    great waves of river Ganges in his matted locks.

                famous historical places of Kumaon hills in Uttarakhand. The present image of Surya in the temple dates
                back to 12th century. Built in the 9th century by Katarmalla, a Katyuri king, this temple is perched at
                an altitude of 2116 m.

                    Shiva-Parvati and Lakshmi-Narayana can also be spotted in this temple. The building faces the east
                    in a
                    way such that the first rays of the sun fall on the Shiva Lingam. Stone-built walls, intricate
                    figures,
                    beautiful pillar carvings and exquisitely cut out wooden doors are among the distinctive features of
                    this temple.

                    The carved wooden doors and panels were transported to the National Museum, Delhi, after the
                    original
                    idol of presiding deity was stolen in the 10th century. The temple, which holds other carvings on
                    walls
                    and panels, was declared a monument of national importance.

                    Though the temple is in a decaying state, it is visited by many devotees who come here to offer
                    prayer
                    to the Sun God. There is no means of transport available after the Kosi River, and thus visitors are
                    needed to walk 2 km on foot in order to reach the temple complex. The route passes through many
                    villages, and one can get a glimpse of the local culture.

                    1500
                    years old, and this Trishul is considered one of Uttarakhand’s oldest remains. It demonstrates the
                    extensive Indo-Tibetan cultural exchange of Tibetan inscriptions in ancient times. The Naga dynasty
                    is
                    described on the Metal Trident, which stands 26 feet tall and is located near the main Shiva temple.

                    The Trishul has an amazing feature in that it cannot be moved with your entire body force, but it
                    vibrates when you apply pressure with one of your fingers

                    Manasa, as it can cure harms. Manasa has a sister, Neta, and these both signify to an indivisible

                    in Sanskrit (be that as it may, different sources say that Her dad was Kasyapa).

                    Kainchi is a term used for two sharp hairpin bends of the motor road in local dialect hence the
                    name. It has NO relation with scissors.

                    Founded by the famous Maharaj Neem Karoli Baba in 1962 and is very well maintained and kept neat and
                    clean.

                    Neem Karoli Baba compassionately followed Lord Hanuman and believed in preaching simple yet
                    spiritually empowering teachings. With his firm beliefs and different way of thinking he won hearts
                    not just in India but abroad as well.

                    The concept of this place came into existence in 1942 when Maharaj Neem Karoli along with Shri
                    Poornanand of the Kainchi Village proposed building an Ashram here dedicated to Sombari Maharaj and
                    Sadhu Premi Baba who used to perform yagnas in this very place. Later in 1962, their dream
                    materialized and the forest from this area was cleared and a rectangular platform was constructed.
                    After due permission from the Forest Conservator, Maharaj Ji acquired the lease of this land and
                    constructed a Temple devoted to Lord Hanuman over that rectangular platform, and adjacent to it are
                    the Kainchi Temple and an Ashram built for devotees.

                    The Hanuman temple is built over the platform mentioned above. His devotees started coming from
                    different places and a chain of Bhandara, kirtans, bhajans started. The Pran-Pratishtha of idols of
                    Hanumanji and others was performed on 15th June in different years. Thus, 15th June is celebrated
                    every year as Pratishtha Divas when a large number of devotees come to Kainchi and get Prasad.

                <span id="more30"> It is said that the Temple is nearly 700 years old. Chaubatia was a dense forest full
                    of wild animal.
                    Leopards and Tigers used to attack people and take away their livestock. People felt scared and
                    prayed
                    to "Maa Durga" for their protection from the dangerous wild animals. It is said that "The Goddess"
                    appeared in a shepherd's dream and asked him to dig up a particular place where he would find an
                    idol
                    and She wanted a temple to be constructed at that site. After that the villagers constructed a
                    temple at
                    that site and installed the Idol of the Deity and thus the villagers were freed from the harassment
                    by
                    wild animals and the shepherd could roam around the area freely.
